              "intro": "Thalbern, a solitary ranger of the Valkarr woods, has always trusted the silence of the wilds more than the promises of men. Orphaned by border raiders and raised by the elves of the Valkrarr Forest, he has spent years living on the edge of Kordavos, guiding travelers, hunting for his own survival, and keeping his distance from the tangled politics of the city. But tonight, a message delivered by a red squirrel bearing the unmistakable script of Wollandora, a trusted elven friend and druid, has drawn him from his hidden home. The note was simple and urgent: Meet me at the Old Standing Stones at midnight. The balance of the forest could depend on it.\n\nNow, as midnight approaches, Thalbern moves quietly through the dense undergrowth, guided by memory and instinct. It's dark with almost no moonlight.\n\nSuddenly, the hush of the night is broken by a sharp crack somewhere off in the darkness.",
              "instructions": "A perception check is appropriate if Thalbernl investigates. If successful, he will determine it is a large creature. If very successful, he will determine it is an Owlbear. If combat ensues and Thalbern is below 25% health, Wollandora will intervene. If Thalbern avoids or defeats the Owlbear, or if Wollandora saves him, he proceeds to the Old Standing Stones.",

Wollandora's words from the previous night echo in his mind â€“ the stolen relics, the suspicious shipment, the urgent need to investigate in Kordavos. The city's tangled ways are far from the quiet paths he knows.\n\nThalbern carefully packed a change of simple, unassuming clothes, ensuring his hunting bow and a quiver of arrows were discreetly bundled, alongside a smaller hand axe and knife. As the sun climbed higher, he left the quiet security of his forest home, turning his steps towards the distant, bustling spires of Kordavos, a place where his survival instincts would be tested in a different kind of wilderness.",
              "instructions": "Prompt Thalbern to consider how he will prepare for his journey to Kordavos. This might involve deciding what gear to pack (emphasizing items useful for a city investigation rather than deep wilderness), considering his appearance to be less conspicuous, or thinking about how he will enter the city. There are no immediate obstacles or checks needed here, it's a narrative transition and planning phase.",
