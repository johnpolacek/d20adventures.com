              "intro": "Docked on a discrete pier on a quiet fork of the Mordava River, a river boat bearing a shipment bound for Kordavos rests silently on the dark, placid water.\n\nThe air is cool and damp, thick with the scent of wet earth and the chirping of crickets. The only other sounds are the gentle lapping of water against the pier's aging pylons and the rustle of wind through the skeletal branches of the willow trees.\n\nLyra stands inside the boat, the mysterious cargo crate before her. The instructions from her contact, Master Valerius, were explicit. Her sole purpose is to verify the authenticity of a Valkaaran artifact using her arcane talents. She is to confirm its magical properties, give a simple nod, and her part will be done. She will be well compensated for her expertise and, more importantly, her discretion.\n\nFor her part, it was hard to resist getting the chance to interact with reclusive Faelendarian elves and also get a chance to be near a Valkaran relic. She had studied both at length, but there was a big difference between reading old dusty tomes and experiencing the real thing.\n\nShe did not know much of her two escorts. There was Varius Reinhard, a large gruff soldier type who was in charge of security for this little mission. The other was a man who called himself Silas. Where Varius was a stone wall of presence, Silas was a whisper. He was slender, moving with a liquid grace that spoke of a life spent in shadows. \n\nMeanwhile, from his cleverly concealed vantage within a tangle of overgrown reeds, Poppen Quickfoot watched the scene unfold, a small smile playing on his lips. The cool water of the Mordava lapped just inches from his boots, but he remained utterly still, his senses stretched. Weeks of patient stakeouts had led him to this exact predawn hour, this quiet fork of the river, following the threads of rumor about a clandestine trade. His instinct, honed by a lifetime of seeking out hidden value, told him this was it—the score that would truly mark his arrival in Kordavos.\n\nHis keen hazel eyes, accustomed to discerning worth from a glint in the dark, tracked the three figures on the pier. The hulking soldier, the robed woman, and the whispering shadow-man. A professional crew, indeed; no sloppy thugs. This wasn't just any cargo; this was an item of importance, something worth securing. Poppen’s mind raced, not just with the thought of fencing such a treasure, but with the delicious social connections such a coup would bring.\n\nA soft creak of wood from the ship cuts through the night's quiet hum as the cabin door opened. A figure emerges with a silent, deliberate grace that was distinctly elven. He is tall and lithe, clad in dark, practical leather armor. Two other elves, equally silent and alert, could be seen on the boat's deck, one near the bow and another by the stern, both armed with bows.\n\nThe lead elf steps forward to the edge of his boat, his gaze settling on Lyra's escorts. His voice is low and clear, carrying easily across the water without being loud.\n\n\"You have the arrangement?\" asked the elf.\n\n“I have it here Aelar,” Silas replies, gliding from the shadows at the base of the pier. He removes a heavy scrollcase from its oilskin wrapping.\n\n\"Very well,\" Aelar says, turning to give an order in Elvish to one of his crew. \"The shipment is ready for your specialist's inspection.\"\n\n“Ok, let’s get on with it then,” says Varius, nodding at Lyra, eager to get her to inspect the shipment and have the matter concluded. The crate remained closed. No one was allowed to see what was inside.\n\nLyra had been contracted for one simple task, use her magecraft to determine that the contents of the shipment were indeed arcane in nature.",
              "instructions": "If Lyra asks questions or stalls in any way, Varius and Silas will be impatient and urge her to do what she was paid for. If Lyra tries to engage Aelar in conversation he will be evasive. If she continues to delay, then Silas will nod at Varius who will draw his sword and threaten her.\n\nIf Lyra successfully casts a spell on the crate to detect magic, she will be detect an ancient potent enchantment on an object within the crate. On a highly successful roll of 18 or higher, she will determine its purpose to be related to concepts of binding promises, loyalty, and solemn vows. On a natural twenty, she will be able to name the item as the Verodynian Oath Stone of the First Clans.",

A dagger appeared in his hand, its point aimed steadily at Aelar. \"There seems to have been a misunderstanding,\" Silas said, his voice dropping to a silken threat. \"My employers do not appreciate being sold worthless trinkets.\"\n\nVarius Reinhard let out a low, guttural growl, his hand dropping to the hilt of the massive blade at his side. \"You have nerve, elf,\" he snarled, his cold, calculating eyes promising violence as he took a heavy step forward.\n\nAelar Moonglimmer recoiled, but it was with the shock of indignation, not fear. His professional calm fractured into unconcealed fury. \"Worthless?\" he spat, his gaze flicking with contempt toward the unseen specialist. \"Your arcanist is either a fool, or you mean to double-cross us!”",

She spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes, deciphering forgotten languages, and piecing together fragmented histories.",
